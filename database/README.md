# Databases and SQL Operations

Welcome to the "database" folder! In this section, you'll find databases created during the Leadway Frontend Training program, along with a note containing explanations and examples of various SQL operations covered in the curriculum.

## SQL Operations

During the training program, we learned and practiced various SQL operations essential for database management and querying. These operations include:

- **SELECT:** Retrieving data from a database.
- **INSERT INTO:** Adding new records to a table.
- **UPDATE:** Modifying existing records in a table.
- **DELETE:** Removing records from a table.
- **CREATE TABLE:** Creating a new table in a database.
- **ALTER TABLE:** Adding, modifying, or dropping columns in an existing table.
- **ORDER BY:** Sorting the result set in ascending or descending order.
- **INNER JOIN:** Combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

The provided note in this folder contains detailed explanations and examples of these SQL operations to help reinforce your understanding.

## Databases

This folder includes databases created during the training program. These databases serve as practical examples for applying SQL operations and database management concepts. The databases included are:

1. **music_streaming_service_db:** A database representing a music streaming service, containing tables for artists, albums, songs, playlists, etc.
2. **leave_db:** A database for managing leave requests and approvals, with tables for employees, leave types, leave requests, etc.
3. **school_db:** A database for a school management system, including tables for students, courses, grades, attendance, etc.

Feel free to explore these databases and interact with them using SQL queries to practice the SQL operations covered in the curriculum.
