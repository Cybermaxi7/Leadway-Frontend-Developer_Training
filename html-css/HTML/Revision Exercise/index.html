        <p>
            <strong>1984</strong> is a dystopian novel by English novelist
            George Orwell. Published in 1949, the novel is set in a totalitarian
            society ruled by the Party and its leader, Big Brother. The novel
            explores themes of <em>surveillance</em>, <em>propaganda</em>, and
            <em>censorship</em>.

        <!-- Paragraph with a personal reflection on the book -->
        <p>
            This book is one of my favorites because it provides a
            thought-provoking look at the dangers of totalitarianism and extreme
            political ideology. Orwell's vision of a world where personal
            freedom is obliterated by a powerful government is both chilling and
            fascinating.

        <!-- Paragraph with a call to action for the reader -->
        <p>
            If you haven't read <strong>1984</strong>, I highly recommend
            picking it up. It's a powerful reminder of the importance of freedom
            and the impact of unchecked power.
