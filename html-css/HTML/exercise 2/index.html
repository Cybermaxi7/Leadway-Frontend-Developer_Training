        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Preparing the Chips</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Peel and Cut Potatoes:</strong> Peel the potatoes and cut
            them into chips (fries) or use pre-cut frozen chips.<br />
            <strong>2. Rinse and Dry:</strong> Rinse the cut potatoes in cold
            water and pat them dry with a paper towel.<br />
            <strong>3. Heat Oil:</strong> In a deep fryer or large pot, heat the
            oil to 350°F (175°C).<br />
            <strong>4. Fry the Chips:</strong> Fry the chips in batches until
            golden and crispy, about 4-5 minutes per batch.<br />
            <strong>5. Drain and Season:</strong> Remove the chips from the oil
            and drain on paper towels. Season with salt while hot.
        </p>

        <h3>Preparing the Egg</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Beat the Eggs:</strong> In a small bowl, beat the eggs
            with a pinch of salt and pepper.<br />
            <strong>2. Heat the Pan:</strong> In a non-stick pan, melt the
            butter or heat the oil over medium heat.<br />
            <strong>3. Cook the Eggs:</strong> Pour the beaten eggs into the
            pan. Stir gently until the eggs are fully cooked but still soft,
            about 2-3 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3>Preparing the Peppered Chicken</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Season the Chicken:</strong> Season the chicken pieces
            with salt, pepper, and paprika.<br />
            <strong>2. Brown the Chicken:</strong> In a large skillet or pot,
            heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces
            and brown them on all sides. Remove the chicken and set aside.<br />
            <strong>3. Cook the Vegetables:</strong> In the same skillet, add
            the chopped onions and garlic. Sauté until the onions are
            translucent, about 3-4 minutes.<br />
            <strong>4. Add Peppers and Tomatoes:</strong> Add the bell peppers
            and chili peppers. Cook for another 2-3 minutes. Then add the
            crushed tomatoes and dried thyme.<br />
            <strong>5. Simmer:</strong> Return the chicken to the skillet. Cover
            and simmer on low heat for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is
            cooked through and tender.<br />
            <strong>6. Adjust Seasoning:</strong> Taste and adjust seasoning
            with salt and pepper if needed. Garnish with fresh parsley if
            desired.
        </p>

        <h2>Serving</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Plate the Chips:</strong> Place a serving of chips on
            each plate.<br />
            <strong>2. Add the Eggs:</strong> Add a portion of scrambled eggs
            next to the chips.<br />
            <strong>3. Serve the Chicken:</strong> Place a piece of peppered
            chicken on each plate, along with some of the pepper sauce from the
            skillet.
